  "match": false,
  "confidence": 0,
  "reasoning": "The second image is highly unclear and does not provide enough information to compare with the first image. The first image shows a man with distinct features such as a dark sweater, jeans, sneakers, and a cap. In contrast, the second image is too blurry and partial to identify any comparable features. Therefore, there is no basis for a match."
